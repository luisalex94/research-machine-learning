When the correlation coefficient between two numerical attributes is closer to both ends of the spectrum (-1 or +1), it shows that the two attributes are showing similar statistical information and perhaps one of them is redundant. When two attributes have a significant and positive correlation coefficient (greater than 0.7), that means if the value of one attribute increases the value of the other attribute will also increase."
